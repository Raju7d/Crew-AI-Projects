# An End-to-End AI Agentic News Research & Writing System using CrewAI

## 1. Problem Statement

In today's fast-evolving tech landscape, discovering innovative technologies and presenting them in an easily digestible format is a real challenge. This project solves that by building an autonomous AI-based system capable of:

- Conducting deep research on any given tech topic
- Communicating with multiple agents
- Generating compelling, well-written blog-style news content

## 2. Project Overview

This project uses **CrewAI** to orchestrate two specialized agents:

1. **News Researcher Agent**:  
   - Performs in-depth research using a Google search simulation (via Serper.dev)
   - Gathers insights and facts about the given topic

2. **News Writer Agent**:  
   - Converts the research into human-readable blog/news content
   - Writes in a clear, engaging, and accessible tone

These agents use **Google‚Äôs Gemini LLM** to simulate reasoning, writing, and planning tasks.

## 3. Tech Stack Used
Python - Core language for development 
CrewAI - for agent framework
Langchain - for tool/memory integration
Google Gemini - for LLM capabilities
Serper.dev API - for lightweight Google Search API
